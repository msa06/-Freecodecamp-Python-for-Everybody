Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the
type (of the value of the expression).
1. width//2
2. width/2.0
3. height/3
4. 1 + 2 * 5
Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

width = 17
height = 12.0

res1 = width // 2
print(f"Value = {res1} and Type = {type(res1)}")
res2 = width/2.0
print(f"Value = {res1} and Type = {type(res2)}")
res3 = height/3
print(f"Value = {res1} and Type = {type(res3)}")
res4 = 1 + 2 * 5
print(f"Value = {res1} and Type = {type(res4)}")
